# HW 1 Marketing Analytics 2026

## Overview

Students shall build a complete **Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline** using Python and Scikit-learn.

The project focuses on:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning pipelines
- Model evaluation
- Prediction generation

Students must complete the provided Python starter code by implementing all required functions.
This can be accomplished using the course evirnment or creating your local Python environment

---

## Step 2 — Dataset Overview
Perform basic exploratory analysis.

Expected tasks:
- Display dataset shapes
- Identify missing values
- Display summary statistics

---

## Step 3 — Split Features and Target
Separate:
- Feature variables (`X`)
- Target variable (`y`)

---

## Step 4 — Identify Column Types
Detect:
- Numerical columns
- Categorical columns

---

## Step 5 — Build Preprocessing Pipeline
Create preprocessing pipelines for:
- Numerical features
- Categorical features

Expected preprocessing:
- Missing value handling
- Feature scaling
- One-hot encoding

---

## Step 6 — Build Model Pipeline
Create a full machine learning pipeline using:
- Preprocessor
- Test at least 3 different models for comparison
---

## Step 7 — Train Model
Train the machine learning model using:

```python
model.fit()
```

---

## Step 8 — Generate Predictions
Generate:
- Predicted labels
- Prediction probabilities

---

## Step 9 — Evaluate Model
Compute:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC

---

## Step 10 — Confusion Matrix
Generate and display a confusion matrix.

---

## Step 11 — Feature Importance Analysis
Analyze model interpretability:
- Extract feature importance values
- Visualize top features

---

## Step 12 — Save Training, Test and Predictions
Save predictions into:

```bash
churn_predictions_dataset1_train.csv
churn_predictions_dataset2_train.csv
churn_predictions_dataset1_test.csv
churn_predictions_dataset2_test.csv
churn_predictions_dataset1.csv
churn_predictions_dataset2.csv

```

# Submission Requirements

Students must submit:

| File | Required |
|---|---|
| Completed Python script | Yes |
| Generated predictions CSV | Yes |
| Feature importance plot | Yes |
| Presentation of 3-5 slides | Yes |

This applies to both dataset provided.

---

# Expected Output

The program should:
- Train successfully
- Print evaluation metrics
- Display feature importance plots
